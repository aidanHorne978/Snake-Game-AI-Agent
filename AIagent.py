""" 

To do list:


    - Need to be aware that i need to be able to run multiple AIagent's with multithreading processing so it doesn't take years to learn.
      Might not be more efficient but will have to test.
      Could move it all into snake.py and then use Pool() to make multiple instances of the snake.py file running 10 Player's at once. Then it will return it's best
      Agent and those 5 agents can be used to vs the player. Will make training time quicker but not sure if it's possible to implement.


    - New class for the player to be able to play the game again.
    - New class to let the player go head to head against a trained agent.
    - Graphing of training and how the neural network operates.
    - Work on GUI and make it more user friendly.

    - mutation(population): After generation 30 the model could be overfitted and need new genes to generate smarter snakes.
      Currently it overrides too many chromosomes so need to tinker.
    - trainGen(population, generation): Need to store the best n agents and return them.
